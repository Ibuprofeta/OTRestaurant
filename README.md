Cooking mini-game produced for a occupational therapy degree team of the University of Vic. The therapy team offered the idea and the theme they wanted for a game focused on people suffering from ADHD, which we developed during one of the subjects of the degree. The mini-game is based on running the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking and building the different recipes with the food and the order in which they are ordered, with the aim of challenging and improving various aspects of the player's attention. Developed using Unity.
